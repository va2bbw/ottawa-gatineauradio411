<p>Roll call of each station that checked in to the previous week&#8217;s net, each station responds as
their callsign is given: <strong><em>DE [their call sign] [optionally GE + name of the NCS] K</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCS responds with <strong><em>[their call sign], GE (for good evening) + [Op&#8217;s name] &lt;AS&gt;</em></strong>. If there is no
response from the called station, NCS issues: <strong><em>NIL</em></strong> and proceeds to the next callsign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the roll-call and acknowledgements, NCS asks for check-ins not on the roll list
with: <strong><em>QNI? K</em></strong>. Any stations wishing to check in will do so and each is acknowledged by the
NCS. These check-ins are added to the roll call list for the next week&#8217;s net. When there are no
further responses to a <strong><em>QNI?</em></strong>, NCS sends: <strong><em>NIL HRD</em></strong>. NCS then sends: <strong><em>QSP?</em></strong>, which requests any
station on net to relay other stations they may have heard but not acknowledged by the NCS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NCS goes through all additional check-ins and end with a final <strong><em>QNI? QSP?</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If nothing heard, then the net will conclude with the NCS making a final transmission: <strong><em>TNX
ALL FOR CHECKING IN, PLN QNF DE [NCS Callsign] 73 ES GE</em></strong></p>
